      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This is my Web Design I final project. This website is about some games that I like to play a lot. I know only three were required, but I got bored and decided to do more (or i didn't, in which case... oops.)<br />
        Regardless, I hope you enjoy it and find it informative or entertaining in some way</p>
      <p>if you want the website with secrets, go to <a href="https://finalwebsitewebdesign.neocities.org">finalwebsitewebdesign.neocities.org</a>. It is MUCH BETTER. I was limited here :(</p>
