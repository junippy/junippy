    <h1>Terraria</h1>
    <p>Terraria is a 2D sandbox game that combines exploration, crafting, building, and combat. You start in a randomly generated world with just a few basic tools. From there, you gather resources like wood, stone, and ores to craft better equipment and build shelters or elaborate structures.
<br><br>
      The world is full of distinct biomes—forests, deserts, jungles, dungeons, and even the underworld—each with unique enemies, items, and challenges. As you explore deeper underground or further across the map, you’ll encounter powerful bosses. Defeating them unlocks new content and triggers world changes, like "Hardmode," which introduces new enemies, gear, and mechanics.
<br><br>
      There are multiple playstyles (melee, magic, ranged, summoner), and progression feels very satisfying as you go from fighting slimes to battling massive, screen-filling bosses. It’s got a retro look, but it’s rich with content, secrets, and creativity—especially in multiplayer.

    <h2>Classes/Playstyles in Terraria</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melee
        <ul>
          <li>The melee class in Terraria focuses on close-range combat using swords, spears, flails, and other physical weapons. It has high defense and strong armor sets, making it a durable, straightforward playstyle. Melee weapons don’t use mana or ammo, and many have powerful effects or fast attacks, especially in later stages of the game.</li> 
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Ranged
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ranged class in Terraria deals damage from a distance using bows, guns, and thrown weapons. It relies on ammo and focuses on precision and mobility. Ranged armor boosts damage and critical hits but has moderate defense, making it a balanced class for staying safe while hitting hard from afar.</li> 
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Magic
        <ul>
          <li>The magic class in Terraria uses mana to cast spells with staffs, tomes, and magic weapons. It focuses on ranged attacks with high damage and versatility, using different elements like fire, ice, or summoning projectiles. Magic users wear armor that boosts mana and magic damage but have lower defense, so positioning and mana management are key to staying alive while dishing out powerful attacks.</li> 
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Summoner
        <ul>
          <li>The summoner class in Terraria uses minions and sentries to fight for them. Instead of direct attacks, summoners summon creatures that automatically target enemies. They have the lowest defense but can deal steady damage while focusing on movement and dodging. Their armor boosts minion count and damage.</li> 
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
